# ‚ôüÔ∏è Play KingCrab Frontend

This is the React-based frontend for **KingCrab**, a Rust-powered chess engine featuring two AI opponents: a CNN-based engine and a HalfKA neural network-based one. The app allows you to play directly in your browser with a responsive UI built using React, Chakra UI, and `react-chessboard`.

## Features

-  Choose between two engine types:
   1) **CNN Bot** ‚Äì a general-purpose convolutional engine
   2) **HalfKA Bot** ‚Äì a fast, chess-specialized model
-  Automatically assigns you the **white side**, so you can experiment openings with your opponents
-  Legal move recommendations with distinct styling for:
  - Normal moves (including castling and en-passant)
  - Captures
-  Responsive and minimal UI with dark theme
-  Game-over detection (checkmate, stalemate, draw)
-  API-driven backend communication with persistent engine state
